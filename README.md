            https://github.com/vidhyaanandh/My_Projects/blob/main/postpartum-depression-1-0.ipynb
      As an independent data scientist, I tried out this dataset. I have done the EDA for this dataset and found some interesting inferences. For example the highest number of pregnant women falls in the age group of 40-45. After applying onehotencoding i tried to apply different model and computed the accuracy.For this dataset, Gradient Boosting and Neural Networks gave me the highest accuracy values.
