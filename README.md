Project 1: Postpartum Depression
    As an independent data scientist tried out this dataset. I have done the EDA for this dataset and found some interesting inferences. For example the highest number of pregnant women falls in the age group of 40-45. After applying onehotencoding i tried to apply different model and computed the accuracy.For this dataset, Gradient Boosting and Neural Networks gave us the highest accuracy values.
